# Mutual-Fund-Analysis
The objective of this project is to simulate a mutual fund plan by analyzing stock price data from multiple Indian companies. We will use Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and finally decide which companies would make the best candidates for inclusion in a diversified mutual fund portfolio.
