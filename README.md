# Mutual Fund Plan Analysis with Python

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to design a **mutual fund investment plan**. Using stock market data from Indian companies, the project walks through the process of cleaning financial data, analyzing company performance, and comparing options to decide which companies would make good candidates for a mutual fund.  

The goal is to show both **financial knowledge** and **data analysis skills** in a practical, business-relevant way.

## Steps Taken to Generate Insights
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered stock price data from multiple Indian companies.  
   - Ensured the dataset included important details such as dates, company names, and closing stock prices.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Converted raw stock price data into a structured format using Python (Pandas).  
   - Standardized the date column and handled missing values to ensure accuracy.  

3. **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
   - Plotted stock price trends over time for each company.  
   - Visualizations highlighted stability vs. volatility in company stock performance.  

4. **Financial Metric Calculation**  
   - **Volatility (Risk):** Measured fluctuations to assess company stability.  
   - **Growth Rates:** Evaluated long-term upward or downward trends.  
   - **Return on Investment (ROI):** Estimated potential profitability.  

5. **Company Comparison**  
   - Compared all companies across risk, growth, and ROI.  
   - Identified safe long-term bets versus high-risk, high-reward options.  

6. **Mutual Fund Design**  
   - Balanced stable companies with consistent growth alongside higher-risk companies with strong return potential.  
   - Designed a simulated mutual fund plan that reduces overall risk through diversification.

## Key Findings
- Some companies showed **steady and reliable growth**, making them safer long-term investments.  
- Others had **higher volatility**, carrying more risk but also the chance for bigger returns.  
- A well-designed mutual fund should combine both types of companies to balance **risk and reward**.
